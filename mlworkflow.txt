Machine Learning Workflow
Whether we're solving a regression problem using linear regression or a classification problem using logistic regression, the workflow for training a model is exactly the same:

We initialize a model with random parameters (weights & biases).
We pass some inputs into the model to obtain predictions.
We compare the model's predictions with the actual targets using the loss function.
We use an optimization technique (like least squares, gradient descent etc.) to reduce the loss by adjusting the weights & biases of the model
We repeat steps 1 to 4 till the predictions from the model are good enough.
